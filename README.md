## Intro

**Problem**: The field of product management is a mystical unicorn: people learn via outdated books, random LinkedIn/Medium articles, and friends of friends neighbors

**Proposed Solution:**: What if there was a platform where those interested in product could share what they learned in the same way open source code works. I've started with a centralized question-answer board to enable people curious about the space to ask questions, but the future vision is a Github tailored to the specific audience.

I have a thesis that no matter the community, democratizing access to high quality knowledge leads to better output. While this is a wildly simplified MVP, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the beginning of a community committed to innovation via sharing their own experience. ‚ú®
